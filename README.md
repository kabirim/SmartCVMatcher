# SmartCVMatcher

SmartCVMatcher is a personal project based on Deep Learning and NLP (Natural Language Processing). It automates the evaluation of resumes against job offers using an **XGBoost** model trained on vector representations generated by Sentence-BERT.  
The application provides a compatibility score for each resume and can rank multiple applications based on their relevance.  
It is deployed via a simple Streamlit interface and uses Sentence-BERT to encode the texts.

SmartCVMatcher is an AI application that **automatically compares resumes to a job offer** and **ranks them by relevance**. This project combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with an **XGBoost classifier** to deliver an intelligent recruitment assistance system.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Predict whether a resume matches a job offer  
- Automatically rank multiple resumes based on their compatibility score  
- Provide a simple interface via **Streamlit**

---

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **XGBoost (XGBClassifier)** â€“ for classification  
- **Sentence-BERT (all-mpnet-base-v2)** â€“ for semantic encoding  
- **scikit-learn** â€“ for data preprocessing  
- **Streamlit** â€“ for the user interface  
- **Pandas, Joblib** â€“ for data management and persistence

## Usage Example  
**Job offer:** Data Scientist with experience in Python, NLP, Machine Learning

**Resumes:** (excerpt)  
- Resume 1: Data Scientist, 5 years experience in Python, NLP  
- Resume 2: Mobile Developer Flutter  
- Resume 3: Junior Data Analyst SQL/Excel

**Result:**  
1. Resume 1 (Score 0.92)  
2. Resume 3 (Score 0.61)  
3. Resume 2 (Score 0.21)

## Future Improvements  
- Support for PDF/Docx files for resume import  
- Download results as CSV  
- Add training with Triplet Loss for better ranking  
- API version with FastAPI
